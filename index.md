# About Me

<img src="https://jim-yw.github.io/me.JPG" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Yuwei Jin (Jim)**.

I am a senior Ph.D. candidate majoring in **CS** at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. Currently, I serve as a research intern  at Argonne National Lab, advised by [Prof. Zheng (Eddy) Zhang](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/zz124/) and [Dr. Ji Liu](https://www.anl.gov/profile/ji-liu). 

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *yuwei[dot]jin[at]rutgers[dot]edu*

## Academic Background

- **Sep 2019 - Present:** Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey (Ph.D. in CS, supervised by [Prof. Zheng (Eddy) Zhang](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/zz124/))
- **Jan 2016 - May 2019:** Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey (BS, Double Major in ECE and CS)

## Research Interests

- Quantum Computing
- Compiler
- Error Correction
- Error Mitigation

My research is centered around **quantum circuit compilation** and **error mitigation** techniques for NISQ quantum devices. Specifically, my research has concentrated on compilation for domain-specific applications, including **VQE**, **QAOA**, and **QFT**. My work guarantees linear-depth for mapped QAOA and QFT circuits on superconducting quantum computers.
